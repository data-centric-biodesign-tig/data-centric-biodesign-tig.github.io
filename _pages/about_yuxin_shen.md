### Yuxin Shen

Yuxin is an EASTBIO PhD student in University of Edinburgh, supervised by Dr Diego Oyarzun in [Biomolecular control group](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/). She is currently working on machine learning methods for cell optimization. Before starting her PhD, she obtained a BSc in Chemistry at Fudan University, and an MSc in Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London.

#### Research Interests

Yuxin's research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and synthetic biology, with a particular emphasis on deep learning methods for optimisation of protein production and the genotype-phenotype mapping problem. With deep learning pipelines, cellular behaviour can be predicted and used for radically improving strain performance. This could be helpful to accelerate cell factories development with a minimal experimental burden.
