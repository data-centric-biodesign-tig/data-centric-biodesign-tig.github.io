I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Chris' Barnes research group [Computational Systems and Synthetic Biology](https://ucl-cssb.github.io/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where my primary focus is on the intersection of artificial intelligence and microbiology. My academic path began at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Evolutionary Biology. I furthered my studies in the United States, obtaining a Master's in Bioengineering and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Utah. My doctoral research laid the foundation for my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Boulder, Colorado, where I delved into the intricacies of genetic circuitry. Currently, at UCL, my work revolves around leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to model and engineer resilient microbial communities. 

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
