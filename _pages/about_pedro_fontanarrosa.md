I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Chris' Barnes research group [Computational Systems and Synthetic Biology](https://ucl-cssb.github.io/) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where my primary focus is on the intersection of artificial intelligence and microbiology. 

My academic path began at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), Argentina, where I earned both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Evolutionary Biology. I furthered my studies in the United States, obtaining a Master's in Bioengineering and a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Utah. My doctoral research laid the foundation for my postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Boulder, Colorado, where I delved into the intricacies of genetic circuitry. 

Currently, at UCL, my work revolves around leveraging AI and machine learning techniques to model, understand, and engineer interactions within microbial communities to produce stable communities for synthetic biology.
