## Aims

Advancing our ability to engineer biology is a strategic priority for the UK. Data-centric approaches are playing an increasingly important role in enabling the development of highly predictive models to accelerate biological design and engineering. However, many of the existing research programs in this area are disjoint, lacking a clear long-term vision and a community to support future growth and development. This interest group will position the Alan Turing Institute front and centre of this discipline and leverage its national role to support its future growth and development. The Institute will provide a physical location and access to deep expertise in data science and AI to develop the necessary theory and computational tools for engineering biology towards positive real-world impact. The core aims are:
1. **Community** – Build a diverse and inclusive community that bridges the biological, social, mathematical, and computational sciences to find practical, data-centric solutions for the effective engineering of biology.
2. **Theory and tools** – Develop new theory, computational tools, and biological methods to overcome existing challenges for data-centric approaches to engineering biology. We will focus on issues surrounding standardisation, the cost of data acquisition, how to integrate heterogeneous data types, the multi-scale nature of biological systems, interpretable methods, and trustworthiness/ethical considerations.
3. **Training** – Offer training opportunities for community members to learn from each other and better understand the unique difficulties of using diverse, noisy, and often incomplete biological data for the practical engineering of living systems.
4. **Connections for impact** – Foster new connections between researchers, funders, government, and industry to guide strategic policy decisions that ensure the leading UK position in data science and engineering biology is maintained, as well as our future technological readiness in this emerging intersection of fields.
