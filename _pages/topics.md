## Introduction

Our groupâ€™s core mission is to advance the field of engineering biology through the application of data-centric approaches. By bringing together interdisciplinary expertise from biology, computer science, engineering, and AI, we aim to overcome key challenges in the design and optimization of biological systems. For more information on our aims, research areas, and how to get involved, please visit our [official website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/data-centric-biological-design-and-engineering).

Our work spans several focus areas within engineering biology and artificial intelligence. The following topics capture the main themes we explore in our sessions and discussions:

#### Protein Design and Genotype-Phenotype Mapping

This session explores the forefront of protein design and genotype-phenotype mapping. We focus on how computational models and machine learning techniques are being used to predict protein structures and functions from genetic information. The session will highlight innovative applications in drug discovery, synthetic biology, and personalized medicine, demonstrating the potential to design proteins with specific functions and to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic traits.

#### Automation of Biological Systems

This session focuses on the automation of biological systems, showcasing the integration of robotics, artificial intelligence, and high-throughput screening technologies. We will discuss how these automated systems are transforming biological research by accelerating experimental processes, improving reproducibility, and enabling large-scale studies. Attendees will gain insights into the latest developments in laboratory automation and how these technologies are being utilized to streamline complex biological workflows, from sample preparation to data analysis.

#### Physically-informed Biodesign

Physically-informed biodesign leverages principles from physics and engineering to create robust and efficient biological systems. This session delves into how physical models and simulations are used to inform the design and optimization of biological processes and materials. Topics include the application of biomechanics, fluid dynamics, and materials science to biodesign, providing a comprehensive overview of how interdisciplinary approaches are being used to solve complex biological problems and develop new biotechnologies.

#### Genomics and Microbial Engineering with Big Data

Our final session focuses on genomics and microbial engineering, emphasizing the role of big data in these fields. We will discuss how large-scale genomic data sets are being analyzed to uncover new insights into microbial functions, interactions, and ecosystems. This session covers the use of advanced data analytics, bioinformatics, and machine learning techniques in genomics research, demonstrating how these tools are driving discoveries in microbial engineering, biotechnology, and environmental microbiology.
